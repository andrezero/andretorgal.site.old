### Issues

- [ ] Types for `rehype-raw` `rehype-react` `remark-parse` and `remark-rehype` added manually, waiting for [this PR](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/383) to be merged, posted on [unified community](https://spectrum.chat/unified/type-definitions/missing-typings-across-plugin-community~49ee93c0-23bf-49f3-9706-2468b0760564)
- [ ] `react-static` interfering with `@reach/router` set focus, opened an [issue here](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/issues/1147)

### Puzzles

- [ ] `react-static` [docs](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/docs/api.md#reloadClientData) mentions `reloadCliendData()` should be used to re-render when data changes, but I only got it to work by using the undocumented api `rebuildRoutes()`
- [ ] `@reach/router` [anchor link support](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/235) and how to tame [focus and scroll on long content](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/62)
