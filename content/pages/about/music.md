This page is about my music.

## Espírito da Paz

This was back in 2009, I believe. I was spending a lot of time on my own, recording instrumental rock versions of all the songs in this [1994 Madredeus album](https://play.spotify.com/album/7ksuir9e0otEfmJGylzqSF?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open).

That's me, recording in my home studio, playing all the instruments except the cello.

These two tracks, in particular, I was quite happy with the result.

## Soon

Bare with me while I collect my old stuff. I'm trying to get in touch with old band mates and find out what they managed to keep and port to digital.
